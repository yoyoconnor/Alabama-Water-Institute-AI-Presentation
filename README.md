## **Flood Detection and Water Management System (Educational Resource)**

Developed by **Connor Barbaccia (@yoyoconnor)** in the University of Alabama's **Sensor Automated Intelligence (SAIL) Laboratory**, this project provides an educational resource for the Alabama Water Institute (AWI) aimed at enhancing flood detection and water management using advanced technologies. The system demonstrates the integration of Neural Networks (NNs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Large Language Models (LLMs) to model and predict flood risks, offering valuable insights into water management practices.

### **Key Features:**
- **Flood Prediction and Monitoring**: Introduces students to predictive models used for forecasting flood risks based on historical data and environmental conditions.
- **Document Retrieval with RAG**: Explains how retrieval-augmented generation works by pulling relevant documents from a knowledge base to support flood detection decisions.
- **Neural Network (NN) Insights**: Shows how NNs process and understand flood-related data, demonstrating the power of machine learning in real-world applications.
- **Large Language Model (LLM) Application**: Utilizes language models like GPT to generate human-readable insights, helping explain the results from data analysis in flood management.

### **Technologies Used:**
- **PyTorch**: For building and training Neural Networks.
- **FAISS**: For efficient document retrieval in the RAG system.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For implementing Large Language Models like GPT.
- **Satellite and IoT Integration**: To provide real-time flood monitoring and data collection.

### **Use Case:**
This project serves as an educational resource provided by the SAIL Lab to AWI, helping students and professionals learn about the applications of AI, machine learning, and real-time data analysis in flood detection and water management. By integrating these technologies, the system offers an opportunity for hands-on learning and demonstrates how AI can be used to manage water resources and mitigate flood risks.
